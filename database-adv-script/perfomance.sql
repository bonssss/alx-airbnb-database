-- perfomance.sql
-- SQL queries to retrieve bookings with user, property, and payment details, and their optimized versions
-- Designed for MySQL, aligned with schema in database-script-0x01/schema.sql

-- Initial Query: Retrieve all bookings with user, property, and payment details
EXPLAIN SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status AS booking_status,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.pricepernight,
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount,
    pay.status AS payment_status
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
INNER JOIN payments pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE b.status = 'confirmed' AND b.created_at >= '2025-01-01'
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;

-- Expected EXPLAIN output (initial query, with indexes):
-- - bookings: type=range, rows=~3, key=idx_bookings_created_at (WHERE and ORDER BY)
-- - users: type=ref, rows=~1, key=idx_bookings_user_id (join on user_id)
-- - properties: type=ref, rows=~1, key=idx_bookings_property_id (join on property_id)
-- - payments: type=ref, rows=~1, key=PRIMARY (assuming PK on payment_id, FK on booking_id)
-- - Rows examined: ~3-6 (filtered by WHERE clause)
-- - Cost: Moderate, but multiple INNER JOINs and sorting add overhead

-- Refactored Query: Optimized to reduce joins and leverage indexes
